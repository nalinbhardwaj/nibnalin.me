        <title>Duolingo: The antithesis to the bazaar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Twitter. Uber. Tinder. Spotify. Coursera. These seemingly unrelated companies all share one common feature: they exist as a layer on top of a marketplace. Their bets are deeply and inherently tied to the dimensions of the underlying marketplaces, whether it’s content for reddit, sex for tinder or ride-hailing for Uber&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. About 90% of successful “tech” companies are a layer on a marketplace, and the ed-tech category (with its multitudes of marketplaces like Coursera, MasterClass, EdX, and Udemy) is no exception.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In this bazaar of shopfronts, one company does something interestingly unique: Duolingo. They generate their own content, they define their own platform and they are responsible for their own growth/marketing end-to-end (and they have the cutest mascot ever :]) owning the learner experience end to end. In this post, I'll summarise their S-1, selecting the things I find most interesting and adding some context and commentary to their facts.
&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mission-education&quot;&gt;Mission Education&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by looking at Duolingo’s mission statement, in their words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Duolingo believes that everyone, regardless of how wealthy they are, should have access to high quality education. And for the first time in history, the technology necessary to enable this is in the hands of billions of people, in the form of a smartphone. At Duolingo, we build products native to the smartphone—bite-sized, on-demand and engaging — to make learning accessible and effective, opening doors for everyone alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the interesting prioritization in their mission, while their mobile-first commitment is the centerpiece, language education is not something they choose to fixate on in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders’ noble motivations and tech-driven problem solving approach seem quite natural if we consider their personal backgrounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Luis and Severin met at Carnegie Mellon University, where Luis was a professor in the Computer Science Department and Severin was his Ph.D. student. Luis, a MacArthur Fellow, grew up in Guatemala and witnessed firsthand the tremendous impact that access to high quality education can have on people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: Luis von Ahn was also a co-founder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA&quot;&gt;reCAPTCHA&lt;/a&gt; with his own doctoral advisor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Blum&quot;&gt;Manuel Blum&lt;/a&gt; a few years earlier. Seems like he never had to choose between theoretical academia research and industry startups, after all, scraping the best of both worlds between CMU, reCAPTCHA, and Duolingo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo has managed to distinguish their product so much from their competitors that while Masterclass and Coursera might have synonymous mission statements to that of Duolingo, Duolingo doesn’t even care to name them competitors in their S-1. Funnily enough, the only competitor they directly mention in their “Risk Factors” is Apple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…in 2020, Apple released “Translate,” an iOS translation app developed by Apple for iOS devices, to translate text sentences or speech between several languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, that’s what happens when you make your product so unique compared to others in your segment: Duolingo has carved a small monopoly for itself in the niche of auto-generated content when everyone else in the ed-tech industry was busy fighting the perfect competition of marketplaces. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/3Fx5Q8xGU8k&quot;&gt;Competition is for Losers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;product&quot;&gt;Product&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-think&quot;&gt;How to think&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo considers their product with respect to two interesting “flywheel” effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The learning flywheel: The greater the scale of our learner base, the more we can use insights from data analytics to improve both engagement and efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The investment flywheel: Our learner scale and word-of-mouth growth allow us to focus our capital investments on product innovation and data analytics, as opposed to brand or performance marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/flywheel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flywheels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their way of thinking relies on growth being a natural side effect of an extremely great product, and while product-led growth is not a natural assumption for all startups, it’s certainly the most rewarding model of growth if you can make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-execute&quot;&gt;How to execute&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bets&quot;&gt;Bets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every product must select some large overcasting “bets” about the world their product will live in. If building a great product is an exercise in predicting the future, these bets are the tools we employ to pull the future into the present. Duolingo’s biggest bets, as they describe, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mobile-first world&lt;/strong&gt;: Consumers are increasingly gravitating to mobile, app-based experiences, and Duolingo aims to own the mobile experience from the get-go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun, effective, free&lt;/strong&gt;: Education in future will feel more like games than lessons. Education industry has historically lagged behind other industries, and Duolingo will exploit this to establish their moat: They will use high quality storytelling and strong gamification features to make free game-like educational apps, and use strong technical data analytics and personalization to make their lessons extremely effective.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve established the basis for the story Duolingo is writing, let’s look at their screenplay itself: the product they’ve executed thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acts&quot;&gt;Acts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many dimensions (acts) to any product (screenplay), so let’s break down the beats of Duolingo’s product on all these dimensions (acts) independently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-lesson-beats&quot;&gt;The lesson beats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use 4 beats to enunciate their lessons: skills, levels, lessons, and tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/lesson-beats.png&quot; alt=&quot;Lesson Beats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each &lt;strong&gt;Skill&lt;/strong&gt; introduces new vocabulary, grammar concepts, and linguistic constructs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each Skill is divided into five &lt;strong&gt;Levels&lt;/strong&gt;, and each Level provides learners practice on the same content, but with progressively more challenging exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Each Level consists of a number of engaging, bite-sized &lt;strong&gt;Lessons&lt;/strong&gt; that implicitly teach the vocabulary and linguistic concepts associated with that Skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips&lt;/strong&gt; are short text explanations designed to explicitly teach the concepts that might be hard to grasp when introduced implicitly in Lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-game-beats&quot;&gt;The game beats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gamify their product using many different mechanisms traditionally seen in video games: experience points, streaks, collectibles, and leaderboards. They break down their gamification features as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/game-beats-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Game beats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/game-beats-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Game beats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XP&lt;/strong&gt;: Learners earn Experience Points, or “XP,” for completing learning activities in Duolingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaks&lt;/strong&gt;: A streak represents the number of days in a row that a learner has used Duolingo, and appears as a flame icon in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowns&lt;/strong&gt;: Learners collect crowns upon completion of a Level of a Skill. Accumulating a certain number of crowns unlocks additional features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gems&lt;/strong&gt;: Gems are the Duolingo virtual currency, which rewards learners for accomplishments like leveling up a Skill. This currency allows learners to buy virtual items from our “Shop”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leaderboards&lt;/strong&gt;: Leaderboards are weekly cohorts of 30 learners who compete to earn the most XP. Leaderboards are organized into Leagues based on the volume of XP earned, starting with the Bronze league, and ending with the Diamond league for the highest XP earners. Each week, the top 10 learners in each Leaderboard advance to the next League. Learners can track their Leaderboard progress daily and are motivated to accumulate XP to earn a place in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hearts&lt;/strong&gt;: Hearts ensure that learners are mastering content as they progress through a course. Learners start each day with five Hearts, and then lose a heart for each exercise completed incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-cinematic-universe-beats&quot;&gt;The cinematic universe beats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the original memes and fan art about their adorable owl mascot Duo, Duolingo picked up on the idea of using &lt;strong&gt;storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; as a brand recognition moat. This is a unique marketing strategy, and as they explain, it seems to work very well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2019, we introduced an additional cast of characters to the app, each with their own personality and backstory. Our iconic characters now feature prominently in our Lessons and Stories, cheering learners on as they progress. Already, our characters are regularly the subject of “fan art” created by Duolingo learners and shared on social media. We believe that recognizable characters and character-driven storytelling increase learner engagement and stickiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/cinematic-universe.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Duolingo Cinematic Universe&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-side-story-beats&quot;&gt;The side story beats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most companies, they have a few other side projects that seem like promising bets/surface areas they are still exploring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stories&lt;/strong&gt;: Stories are short, engaging dialogues presented with both text and audio that expose learners to conversational language and support practice of both reading and listening comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/stories.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stories&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio lessons&lt;/strong&gt;: Audio-only lessons allow learners to spend focused time developing listening comprehension skills and practicing speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duolingo ABC&lt;/strong&gt;: an app for young children that teaches early literacy skills, which won the 2020 Time Magazine “Best New Product” award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…we also offer a diverse set of experiences to build language proficiency outside of the app, such as our podcasts. The &lt;strong&gt;Duolingo Spanish podcast&lt;/strong&gt; is consistently among the top five education podcasts in the US on the Apple Podcast platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these seem significant enough (yet!) to impact their bottom line significantly. Nonetheless, these are interesting ideas that could work very well in an alternate world or some context Duolingo hasn’t yet dipped into. I’ll leave this task as an exercise to the reader with the reward for the right solutions being the spawn point for another billion-dollar company. 🐶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;backstage&quot;&gt;Backstage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete the trifecta of making Duolingo “fun, effective and free”, let’s now look at how Duolingo makes learning &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; using machine learning and data analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;machine-learning&quot;&gt;Machine learning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo seems to have taken everything human teachers are good at, productized it into discrete buckets, and use AI for all these interaction surfaces to personalize and optimize lesson flows. Here’s a couple of production examples they cite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…our “student model,” called &lt;strong&gt;BirdBrain&lt;/strong&gt;, which evaluates every learner’s answer to every exercise every day and learns to predict the probability that any learner will answer any given exercise correctly. We use BirdBrain predictions to adaptively construct lessons where each exercise is “just right” in terms of difficulty for each learner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…our &lt;strong&gt;Smart Tips&lt;/strong&gt; system, which uses an AI model to classify common learner mistakes and then briefly interrupts lessons with a relevant “just in time” grammar explanation when needed. Instead of asking learners to repeatedly read through conjugation tables, we accurately classify their mistakes and surface a grammar rule when it is most useful and engaging—right after they make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-analytics&quot;&gt;Data Analytics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo appears to be constantly running tons of A/B tests to improve their lesson engagement and effectiveness, “Data from over 2.3 billion tracking events, broken down into about 1,500 unique event types, generated every day by our learners informs the 500+ A/B tests we run every quarter”. It’s impressive that Duolingo pulls off so many A/B tests cleanly and still sees a net high ROI compared to sales and marketing (which they evaluate as having a lower impact) at their maturity stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hear of products running so many A/B tests, I often feel pessimistic about the company and their vision (or lack thereof) since A/B tests can often be a substitute for product vision — serving as an amortization of risk over conviction. But it becomes hard to complain about these things in the context of an S-1 document filed by the company itself to convince the market to buy their stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sales-and-marketing&quot;&gt;Sales and marketing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sales and marketing is certainly not the primary bread-winner for Duolingo (as they repeatedly make it clear), it’s worth noting their strategic position on it in the different campaigns they’ve run previously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;: For example, in December 2020, we launched our New Year’s 2021 campaign, our largest ad campaign to date, delivering a unified brand message across multiple international markets that resulted in an increase in aided brand awareness of 6% in the United States, 3% in the United Kingdom, and 3% in Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owned media marketing&lt;/strong&gt;: We send our learners personalized emails and push notifications that provide progress reports, lesson reminders, and sometimes a simple message of positivity to encourage them to remain engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;: Our paid acquisition strategy is focused on targeting high quality user segments that are more likely to subscribe and on investing in new markets to kickstart our organic growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic expansion&lt;/strong&gt;: we hire experienced local marketing managers and engage in localized social media and influencer-led campaigns, app store optimization, and paid advertising to generate interest in our products and drive new learner growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climax&quot;&gt;Climax&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ll write more about their general success and the impressive retention/growth they’ve seen in a &lt;a href=&quot;#growth-numbers--all-that-jazz&quot;&gt;later section&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll quickly make a note about the successfulness of some of the individual &lt;a href=&quot;#acts&quot;&gt;Acts&lt;/a&gt; they mention in their S-1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Launching Leaderboards, which encourage both social connectivity and competition, increased the overall average time spent learning on Duolingo by almost 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of our daily active users have a Streak longer than seven days. And approximately one million learners have an active Streak longer than 365 days, meaning they have used Duolingo daily for at least one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One million users (~2.5% MAUs) using an educational app every day for a straight year is nuts! Goes to show they’ve built a product a lot of people love deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On optimization via A/B testing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through A/B testing, we have increased the fraction of learners who came back one day after starting Duolingo from 12% when we first launched in 2012, to over 40% today. A/B tests also provide us with the data to make decisions that positively impact paid subscriber conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This visual depiction of how Duolingo thinks of their funnel is also very informative of their company strategy (besides being a good indicator of their potential vs. realized energy):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/funnel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Funnel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More on monetisation to follow in the &lt;a href=&quot;#monetisation&quot;&gt;Monetisation&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;growth-numbers--all-that-jazz&quot;&gt;Growth, numbers &amp;amp; all that jazz&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers Duolingo shares in their S-1 tell a beautiful story. They have built a product their users love deeply, and their retention metrics reflect this love. But the more remarkable discovery in these numbers is about growth, not retention. Despite having no &lt;strong&gt;natural&lt;/strong&gt; growth loop on the surface, their product seems to have explosive growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t plaster the app with screens asking you to invite friends, nor do they use shady buttons that send invites on your behalf (looking at you, every “social” platform ever) and they don’t rely on paid advertising and other sales-and-marketingy strategies (MasterClass and Udemy seem to rely on this heavily) to acquire users en-masse. So, how do they have such explosive growth? Most of their users come from word-of-mouth referrals. My theory for why word-of-mouth works so well for them is the so-called property of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1402449655208632321&quot;&gt;intrinsic virality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a language is an intrinsically social activity. The only way to get good at communicating in a new language is to… well, communicate with others using it. Unlike a regular classroom where you’re surrounded by other students learning the same language as yourself, you are learning “alone” on Duolingo. What seems like a strict negative for Duolingo is actually a surprising positive since it silently forces this natural growth loop: You have to use your Duolingo education with friends/family outside the app, and that’s perhaps the best kind of word-of-mouth plug any product could ever hope to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo has managed to build something monumental. Besides being the best-in-class language education platform with over 500 million downloads and the top-grossing education app on iOS and Android, their app has outsized socio-cultural impact invisible in the soup of numbers. Model this: “There are more people in the United States learning languages on Duolingo than there are foreign language learners in all US high schools combined, and there are more people learning certain languages on Duolingo, like Irish and Hawaiian, than there are native speakers of those languages worldwide.” and further, “almost 80% of Duolingo users in the US were not already learning a language when they began using Duolingo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Duolingo is probably also one of the most effective educational institutions anyone has built — their 40 million+ MAUs complete 500 million exercises every &lt;strong&gt;day&lt;/strong&gt;. As an independent benchmark, they report findings from an internal study, “People who complete five ‘Units’ of Duolingo, or roughly half of one of our courses, learn as much as students taking four university semesters of language education — and they do so in half the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/proficiency.png&quot; alt=&quot;Proficiency&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-operating-metrics&quot;&gt;Key Operating Metrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by looking at some of their topline metrics: MAUs, DAUs, and Paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/mau.png&quot; alt=&quot;MAUs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/dau.png&quot; alt=&quot;DAUs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/paid-sub.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paid subscribers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from less than 1% paid subscriber penetration in 2017, Duolingo has increased to approximately 4% paid subscriber penetration in 2020. For most freemium products, paid subscriber penetration is between 1-5%, so Duolingo’s 4% is pretty impressive! Here’s paid subscribers as % of MAU over time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/growth-paid-sub-fraction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paid subscribers as % of MAU&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cohort retention, this chart showcasing a fraction of first-time subscription bookings from users who joined the platform that year (in green) vs. users who joined before 2020 (in gray) is a strong indicator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/sub-fraction-cohort.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paid subscription cohort breakdown&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t have a good comparative stat for other freemium products, half the first-time subscriptions coming from old user cohorts seems like a pretty good LTV extraction from Duolingo. Their own comment agrees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We believe this is a business justification for having a high-quality, deeply engaging free user experience: it leads to users staying on the platform over long periods of time and provides us with repeated opportunities to convert them to paid subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/sub-plan-cohort.png&quot; alt=&quot;Subscribers by subscription plan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the push towards the annual subscription plan, annual subscribers went from being ~47% of paid subscribers in 2018 to ~71% in 202. Concerning that, Duolingo notes that subscribers on their annual subscription plan tend to stay on the platform longer and are stickier than subscribers on the monthly plan, and that this push has had a positive impact on subscriber lifetime value. They also note the higher retention rate of annual subscribers: ~40% of annual plan subscribers renew their plans, and ~9% monthly plan subscribers renew their subscription after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;monetization&quot;&gt;Monetization&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rather unfortunate that a large majority of public investors have very little understanding of tech moats and instead almost exclusively care only about monetization and operating metrics. While it’s a good-enough heuristic for their purposes, for us it means a vast majority of an S-1 will focus only on monetization related data, mostly in a bid to reassure potential investors of the hope of profitability. Following the source’s lead, this section will devote itself to only discussing monetization related data, which you may choose to &lt;a href=&quot;#future-strategy&quot;&gt;skip by clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/revenue.png&quot; width=&quot;66%&quot; style=&quot;margin-top: 10px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of the S-1 filing, Duolingo monetized in three ways: Duolingo Plus &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, their paid subscription service with extra features and ad block; advertising and the Duolingo English Test. From their S-1, Duolingo Plus had approximately 1.6 million paying subscribers accounted for approximately 73% of our revenue in 2020. Advertising revenue represented 17% of their revenue, and fees from the Duolingo English Test accounted for ~9%. Duolingo’s revenue has more than doubled every year since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a high level summary of all the monetisation stats mentioned in the S-1, mostly without any of my own commentary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;: $70.8 million in 2019 → $161.7 million in 2020, 129% year-over-year growth.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$28.1 million in Q1 2020 -&amp;gt; $55.4 million in Q1 2021, 97% growth&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Subscription revenue: $54.8 million in Q1 2020 -&amp;gt; $117.5 million in Q1 2021, 114% growth.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross profit&lt;/strong&gt;: $50.0 million in Q1 2020 -&amp;gt; $115.7 million in Q1 2021, 131% year-over-year growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net loss&lt;/strong&gt;:  $13.6 million in 2019 -&amp;gt; $15.8 million in 2020
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$2.2 million in Q1 2020 -&amp;gt; $13.5 million in Q1 2021&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjusted EBITDA aka raw earnings&lt;/strong&gt;: -$8.0 million in 2019 -&amp;gt; +$3.6 million in 2020
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;-$0.9 million in Q1 2020 -&amp;gt; +$0.9 million in Q1 2021&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total bookings aka total earnings&lt;/strong&gt;:  $88.0 million in 2019 -&amp;gt; $190.2 million in 2020, representing 116% growth
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;$36.9 million in Q1 2020  -&amp;gt; $65.8 million in Q1 2021, representing 78% growth.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earning platform breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In 2020, 51% of our revenue and 53% of our total bookings from the Apple App Store, and 19% of our revenue and 20% of our total bookings from the Google Play Store. The leftover is presumably processed by Stripe, their web payments provider (as mentioned in a detailed GAAP measures table elsewhere)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monetisation-in-2020--covid-19&quot;&gt;Monetisation in 2020 &amp;amp; COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t comment too much on the impact of COVID-19 on Duolingo in general, but here are their few comments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We believe that COVID-19 increased our bookings for a period of time in 2020: most notably in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revenue and total bookings by quarter in 2020 (in $M):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&quot;mbtablestyle&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2020 Quarter&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Revenue&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Total Bookings&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Q1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;28.1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;36.9&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Q2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;40.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;49.6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Q3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;45.3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;46.7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Q4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;48.3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;57.1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s their overall take on monetization stats in 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Revenues increased $90.9 million, or 129%, to $161.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, from revenue of $70.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The main driver was an increase in subscription revenue of $62.7 million, primarily due to a 107% increase in the average number of paid subscribers during 2020 as compared to 2019, with the remainder of the increase driven by a change in mix of plans purchased and increased pricing. We also saw an increase in advertising revenues, primarily due to a 58% increase in DAUs during 2020 as compared to 2019, which resulted in increased advertisements served. Average revenue per DAU for our ads also increased year over year, accounting for the remainder of the increase in advertising revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-strategy&quot;&gt;Future Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo notes their opportunity to expand in many regions in Asia and Latin America, citing a couple interesting data points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Asia, for example, our investments contributed to 136% growth in DAUs from 2019 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…as of March 2021, 54% of our MAUs were learning English, and 37% were learning other languages using our English UI; 9% were neither learning English nor using our English UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the expansion potential of the Duolingo English Test, they note that they might face difficulty keeping up with the past growth rate as the pandemic recedes (and universities become hesitant to replace the likes of TOEFL and IELTS), but they also note that the Duolingo English Test revenue increased by $4.3 million in Q1 2021 vs. Q1 2020, which is a good sign of the durability of their past growth, and pandemic being an accelerant, not an impulse function anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the expansion of their sales and marketing channels, they note that they’re planning to devote their overall marketing expenditure to newer advertising channels such as mobile and online video platforms as well as targeted campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;systems&quot;&gt;Systems&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section primarily talks about the systems that run Duolingo behind the scenes: the engineers, managers, designers, marketers, and everyone else who’s assembled as a part of Duolingo the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where most of their 400+ employees work. They also have offices in New York, Seattle, and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/hiring.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cheeky hiring ad campaign Duolingo ran in SF&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the culture they’re building, Duolingo explains their internal operating principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/duolingo/operating-principles.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On hiring, Duolingo mentions a few different stats in their S-1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…we hire one out of every 353 applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have an offer-to-accept ratio of 85% for industry hires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2020, our employee attrition was a record low: four employees, or under 2% of our workforce. In 2019, our yearly attrition was approximately 6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From December 31, 2018 to May 31, 2021, our headcount grew from approximately 140 employees to over 400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the record low attrition is probably something that’s not unique to Duolingo during 2020. From what I can tell, most booming tech companies saw record low attritions during this period, likely due to the extraordinary circumstances of COVID/WFH policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eng--product&quot;&gt;Eng &amp;amp; Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of filing the S-1, Duolingo had a team of ~280 software engineers, product designers and product managers. Approximately 20% of them were on functional engineering teams, building and maintaining foundational infrastructure, while the remaining 80% were on product teams, iterating on features as well as researching and prototyping new product extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expenses&quot;&gt;Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo reports expenses primarily on research &amp;amp; development and sales &amp;amp; marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research &amp;amp; Development accounts for 45% and 33% of their total revenue in 2019 and 2020, and 34% and 41% of revenue in Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, respectively. Most of the increase (~68% increase in 2020 vs. 2019) is attributable to an increase in employee growth and contractor costs incurred to help sustain the revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo spent ~22% of revenue in the sales and marketing department (and saw a ~133% increase in 2020 vs. 2019), with their investments primarily focusing on high-leverage brand advertising and, to a lesser extent, on performance marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;height: 3px;margin-bottom: 24px;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duolingo has accomplished something very unique and counts as one of my most underrated consumer products of the past decade. If this post hasn’t convinced you, I encourage you to download their app and try it out yourself. I convinced a skeptical friend to do this exercise a couple months ago, and despite their complete lack of interest in learning a new language, they had a &amp;gt; 15-day streak on Duolingo at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a vision for a future where GPT-&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; (and generative machine learning in general) will eventually unlock a whole new category of products based on content from these models. Conditioning on that, I wonder if history books from the distant future will see Duolingo as an “early” pioneer of that auto-generated product category. Perhaps, as that category replaces many of the menial human marketplaces in exchange for personalization and consistent quality of AI, we’ll see companies realize an even larger potential of the Duolingo product model, or perhaps Duolingo itself will front-run and dominate this category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr style=&quot;height: 3px;margin-bottom: 24px;&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Necessary disclaimer that I am not associated with Duolingo in any way. I do not own their stock nor have had any direct relationship with the company in the past. I’m just a fan sharing my thoughts about their product. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For completeness, I’ll also note the future-facing bet they mention, “We also have a significant opportunity to impact more learners around the world by extending our platform beyond language learning.” &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bellman's Curse on Advice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the most fundamental challenge we face is just grokking the high dimensionality of a state space. Go is a “simple” game whose rules can be fully explained on a single sheet of paper, yet those rules yield more board configurations than the number of atoms in the universe (~10&lt;sup&gt;174&lt;/sup&gt;). Given the state space, how does any solver for this game even represent these configurations, let alone evaluate them? While games are helpful toys to start with, this phenomenon of “exponential explosion” in systems is extremely common in many real-world problems, where we’ve given it the stage name: &lt;em&gt;Bellman’s Curse of Dimensionality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While popular study of dimensionality is usually focused on tight, mathematical systems, I’ve found that thinking about dimensionality as a metaphor in other, less well-defined systems is a surprisingly helpful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice, for instance, tends to fit such a model very naturally. You have an extremely large state space (&lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;) where you only get one opportunity to traverse a path. To add to that, like the typical exponential problem, as dimensionality of life increases, the volume of the space of possibilities increases so fast that the available data on historical outcomes becomes quite sparse. How, then, can someone evaluate others’ advice, or look at someone else’s life to figure out what they should do with their own?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t claim to have a solution to this problem, but in my experience it’s helpful to keep the dimensionality framework suggested by Bellman in the back of your mind as you navigate advice. For starters, thinking about the dimensions in this space independently is helpful to evaluate different states clearly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time:&lt;/em&gt; Your professor probably don’t have the best advice for you because their own experience about your situation was frozen in 1980s, and a lot about the world has changed since then.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space:&lt;/em&gt; Advice about fundraising from a US entrepreneur is obviously not as relevant for someone raising in India or China.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal state:&lt;/em&gt; This is one of the harder categories to pin down. One way to think about these is as some function of an individual’s personality and thought processes, but I think that only scratches the surface of what this broad category intends to cover. If someone attempts to use Steve Jobs’ offbeat management methods, but lacks the charisma and the “reality distortion field” Steve Jobs is said to have conjured, they’re not going be as successful in their endeavours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found it somewhat surprising how much different, often entirely contradictory, advice you can hear about any choices you can think of. When just about everyone has their own strongly held opinions about everything, it’s really hard to evaluate the applicability and the net delta of any singular piece of advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the only antidote to evaluating advice given such dimensional differences is to figure out relative distortions in the advisor’s state to your state, and “port” the advice as necessary. Don’t do what Napoleon did, do what he &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; do if he was a founder born in silicon valley during the Information Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of this framework is that differences in multiple dimensions scale non-linearly. A 60 year old college professor will always have strictly less &lt;em&gt;applicable&lt;/em&gt; advice, since they are separated from you in time and space vs. someone of your age living in the same city as you. Note that I’m only making a claim about the &lt;em&gt;applicability&lt;/em&gt; of their advice here, whether the advice itself is good or bad is a completely different question that one should evaluate separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, however, there are many flaws in this framework. The most obvious flaw to me is that it isn’t clear if the aforementioned dimensions are linearly independent, and treating them as such has unintended consequences (for instance, someone at different space and time but with the same internal state aren’t necessarily as bad as someone at the same space and time but wildly different internal state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blessing-of-dimensionality&quot;&gt;Blessing of dimensionality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one other interesting result that arises from this framework that’s applicable to advice: &lt;em&gt;the blessing of dimensionality&lt;/em&gt;. In math, the curse of dimensionality leads to a conjugate that feels un-intuitive on first consideration: because exponential problems are so hard, even basic heuristics are good enough to get reasonably close to optimal solutions. The oversimplified explanation for this is that state spaces for such problems are so large that taking random paths is exponentially worse than taking a path that’s just good enough.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first read Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People”, I was extremely surprised by the blandness and obviousness of all the advice it described. Surely, I thought, this couldn’t be a multi-decade bestselling book with advice that claims to have changed countless lives. Weirdly enough, Dale Carnegie doesn’t need his readers to develop Steve Jobs’ charisma to be successful, if they take the basic, most obvious steps they’ll already be good enough to be reasonably successful in life. This “blessing of dimensionality” is why most popular advice you’ll find is un-specific and vague, even though, in practice, most of us will end up applying that advice to the most specific scenarios and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a broader perspective, this conjugate “blessing of dimensionality” is a good reminder to avoid traps of overthinking and taking life overly seriously. If your actions have some reasonable motivations, at the end of the day, the worse you’ll do in expectation is really not that bad in absolute terms: You’re unlikely to end up in a ditch in a forest due to picking a wrong choice at some fork in the road once, if all the other forks you’ve picked before had some reasonable amount of consideration behind them too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The water current at UCSD</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;280&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin-left: 1em; margin-top: 0.5em;&quot; src=&quot;../assets/bottle-counter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bottle Counter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This winter, I decided to collect data from a water bottle filling station’s “bottle counter”. The water bottle filling station is located in a residence hall at UC San Diego. While I assume most of the traffic this station sees are residents of UCSD’s Revelle College, there is some traffic from nearby lecture halls, gardens, cafeterias and restaurants. Unfortunately, this data collection project was cut short by COVID-19 (following which, I returned home), but I could still find some interesting trends in the limited data I ended up with, so I will write about them here&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first graph summarises the bottles since the beginning of data collection (Jan 26):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;observablehq-d8e400d6&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
import {Runtime, Inspector} from &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js&quot;;
import define from &quot;https://api.observablehq.com/@nalinbhardwaj/water-data.js?v=3&quot;;
const inspect = Inspector.into(&quot;#observablehq-d8e400d6&quot;);
(new Runtime).module(define, name =&gt; name === &quot;generaltrendchart&quot; ? inspect() : undefined);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like a pretty nice and consistent line, but if we look at more fine-grained data, we can see some more interesting properties. This following graph looks at estimated numbers on bottles filled per hour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;observablehq-79d2f8f9&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
import {Runtime, Inspector} from &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js&quot;;
import define from &quot;https://api.observablehq.com/@nalinbhardwaj/water-data.js?v=3&quot;;
const inspect = Inspector.into(&quot;#observablehq-79d2f8f9&quot;);
(new Runtime).module(define, name =&gt; name === &quot;bottlesperhourhchart&quot; ? inspect() : undefined);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the line trace itself is smoothened, but if you hover over the graph, you can see the exact values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this connected scatterplot tries to visualise this data in a slightly different way, trying to look for any patterns in water consumption at different times over a day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;

#test {
}

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;test&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;observablehq-741e02d9&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;

import {Runtime, Inspector, Library} from &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js&quot;;
import define from &quot;https://api.observablehq.com/@nalinbhardwaj/water-data.js?v=3&quot;;

const test = document.querySelector(&quot;#test&quot;);

const stdlib = new Library;

const library = Object.assign({}, stdlib, {width});

function width() {
  return stdlib.Generators.observe(notify =&gt; {
    let width = notify(test.clientWidth);

    function resized() {
      let width1 = test.clientWidth;
      if (width1 !== width) notify(width = width1);
    }

    window.addEventListener(&quot;resize&quot;, resized);
    return () =&gt; window.removeEventListener(&quot;resize&quot;, resized);
  });
}
const inspect = Inspector.into(&quot;#test&quot;);
const inspectButton = Inspector.into(&quot;#observablehq-741e02d9&quot;);
(new Runtime(library)).module(define, name =&gt; name === &quot;chart&quot; ? inspect() : (name === &quot;viewof replay&quot; ? inspectButton() : undefined));
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The x axis in this chart represents the 24 hour hour of day and the y axis writes about estimates of bottles filler per hour. The most obvious pattern in this, and the previous chart, relate to the unusual spike on February 24th. More on that later. There don’t seem to be any other obvious patterns here (there seems to be a slight increase towards the evening/night, but that doesn’t seem very statistically significant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;february-24&quot;&gt;February 24&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me a long time to trace the unusual spike on February 24 to a definite event. But this anomaly appears to be the result of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ucsdcola.net&quot;&gt;UCSD 4 COLA&lt;/a&gt; protests. These protests were part of the larger COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) strikes &lt;a href=&quot;https://payusmoreucsc.com/faq/&quot;&gt;across the UCs&lt;/a&gt;, and February 24 was a particularly important day for these protests: looking back at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ucsd&quot;&gt;r/UCSD&lt;/a&gt;, I see lots of posts discussing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/f6zfhy/what_was_the_protest_about/&quot;&gt;large gatherings&lt;/a&gt; and the temporary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/f721q5/what_happened_at_geisel_today/&quot;&gt;closure of the Geisel Library&lt;/a&gt; (the largest library at UCSD). My best explanation for this data anomaly is that students were just out and about a lot more on this day, and this trivial water bottle counter’s readings reflect that change in footfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found data explorations very exciting due this innate property data tends to have. Data is an unbiased source of truth that doesn’t error (or “forget”) about things. While the pandemic occupied the collective attention spans of most UCSD students, these protests were just… forgotten? Looking up online, UCSD’s student newspapers don’t seem to have given these protests enough attention (and of course, the UCSD administration were happy to suppress any discussion about these too).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shadows of Stained Glass</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;link-to-paper&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;//nibnalin.me/assets/stained-glass.pdf&quot;&gt;Link to paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of this post, I’ve linked my paper analysing the films &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(1988_film)&quot;&gt;Akira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/a&gt;. These are both seminal films that have greatly influenced modern horror/thriller/futuristic films, and as a result, they have been picked over by numerous reviewers and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my approach to analysing these films is quite different from the conventional methods. I use data analysis tools to make observations about “macro” trends in the films, and try to rationalise these observations using scenes and clips. If nothing, you should enjoy the pretty pictures on Page 6 and Page 12, which constitute the bulk of my data visualisation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thoughts-on-this-methodology&quot;&gt;Thoughts on this methodology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feedback from the use of this method is mixed. It gives reasonably good results when we are dealing with anime films (as it did for the films I chose to look at). I suppose this success can be attributed to the tight control on lighting and colors the artists can exert in such a medium. Dealing with real life environments allows for little creative experimentation, and for most real-life films, color palletes are more akin to side effects of physical circumstances, not intentionally curated creative visions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is much, much more time consuming compared to a standard movie review/analysis, for which the most time consuming task is probably just watching the film a couple times. In comparison, neglecting the actual visualisations, simply processing all the frames of a film takes over 4-5 hours on my 2012 laptop. In a world where speed is king, especially in media, these turnaround times are simply not viable for independent journalists. Perhaps, this method becomes much more viable when you have a large team of data scientists and software engineers at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I still hope my project inspires audiences to reconsider how they’ve looked at the particular films Akira and Ghost in the Shell (both of which, by the way, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/47/Akira&quot;&gt;criminally&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Koukaku_Kidoutai&quot;&gt;underrated&lt;/a&gt; on MAL) and perhaps, even reimagine the entire methodology of film analyses with me. With computers as our “bicycles for the mind”, there is definitely a lot left to be done in the film department, and I hope that my analysis functions as a glimpse of that potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23533283&quot;&gt;Hacker News discussion of this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the Hacker News crowd really liked this style of analysis, driving over 25,000 unique visitors to this page over the past day or so. If you’re here from HN, consider checking out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://nibnalin.substack.com/&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion there is quite interesting. Several users link similarly esoteric analyses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://typesetinthefuture.com&quot;&gt;Typeset in The Future&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://anime-architecture.org&quot;&gt;Anime Architecture exhibition&lt;/a&gt; are my personal favourites from that thread.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Manic Pixie Dream Girls of Antiquity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For reference, MPDG is a common trope described &lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dream_Girl&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;//youtu.be/WwGjpPlgqyo&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;. This essay tries to make sense of women in antiquity literature in this context. It presumes some knowledge of antiquity literature writings (and characters such as Pandora, Eve and Penelope), but it should be reasonably interesting even if you are unfamiliar with these characters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pandora&quot;&gt;Pandora&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandora is the ideal woman. She does everything her creator, Zeus, instructs her to. She shows no feelings, no motivations, no ideas. No identity, in fact. She is a pawn in a fight between the humans, gods, and titans. And yet, even in these torrid circumstances, she is built to be the epitome of pure, feminine beauty. She is a submissive, enigmatic, mechanical idea of a woman (if you can call her that). This is the ideal woman. In a misogynist, patriarchal society, this is the ideal woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we treat Pandora as a stereotypical (albeit flawed) model of an ideal woman, we can see how, in breaking this prototype, Eve and Penelope assert the long road to women’s revolutions. Eve and Pandora are flawed characters. And these flaws, are, in fact, a sign of the established society’s fear of the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pandora is an objective-driven character. Unlike gods and men, she is never even treated as a first-class citizen in the &lt;em&gt;Theogony&lt;/em&gt;: the book talks at length about her characteristics and her deficiencies, but somehow, Hesiod forgets to mention her name. The idea of women, in Hesiod’s writings overall, is best described as this archetype that taps into the fantasy of soulmates: women exist only to “complete” men. They have no wants, no aspirations of their own. Instead, they are a collection of vague traits society has projected on them. Pandora is the penultimate stereotype of a “cold-hearted bitch” (Hesiod, &lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 69) that exists only to please her father and husband. Young (&lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 64), shallow (her only skills: weaving and deceiving (&lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 65-79)), ethereal and childlike (&lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 73): If you make a checklist of traits associated with Pandora, she is what modern screenwriting would chalk up to be a “Manic Pixie Dream Girl”. Modern critics would see her as someone who exists in the minds of bad screenwriters trying really hard to force a narrative. How is it that Hesiod, writer of such timeless books, is evaluated as a bad screenwriter by modern standards? The “problem” is, Hesiod is not a modern writer. I think, for Hesiod, this isn’t a case of poor writing, it is a byproduct of poor consideration for the very state of women. He (and the society) has treated women as objects for so long, he fails to recognize the impracticality of this concept of a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hesiod’s writings’ express a lot of confusion about what an ideal woman is supposed to be, and for good reason: Greek society is at a crossroads. The modern women’s rights revolutions still have a ways to go, but the fire of dissatisfaction has started brewing in their thoughts and actions. The idea of women as characterless, emotionless automatons is no longer sustainable. As they develop a voice, there is an inherent fear of the consequences of the unknown. And Hesiod’s writing represents this tug of war between the established view of a woman and the resistance to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, Hesiod repeatedly enforces the idea that the ideal woman is someone having no character, as an unadulterated (mentally, and physically) virgin (&lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 695-705). Yet, on the flip side, in &lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, Zeus describes women as distractions for men. In a zero-sum game, if you give your opponents a line of attack, they will try their best to cling to it, often failing to notice how they make themselves weaker on other fronts. Of course, if society assigns value to women being objects of lust, a subset of them will become very successful at being exactly that — succulent whores. Of course, women will be “helpmates in deeds of harshness” (Hesiod, &lt;em&gt;Theogony&lt;/em&gt;, 601) when that is the image you have been projecting on them for years, Zeus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eve&quot;&gt;Eve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us look at Eve through this lens. The “inciting incident” of Genesis is the consumption of the forbidden fruit, and this event is a direct consequence of Eve’s actions. Yet, in Genesis, Eve’s existence feels rather incidental. She is made (or rather, extracted) when Adam is looking for a helper, and her very description, wo-man, hints at the shallowness of the character. Again, from a modern screenwriting perspective, Eve’s character arc would be of vital importance. And yet again, just like the “Magical Girlfriend” (&lt;a href=&quot;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko&quot;&gt;Yamato Nadeshiko&lt;/a&gt;) of a Shōnen manga (comics primarily intended for “boys” or “youth”), another derogatory, poorly thought out ideal of a woman (an eastern equivalent to the western “Manic Pixie Dream Girl”), Eve’s remarkable initiative is covered up as an innocent mistake. Notably, while Priestly accounts of the Bible are notorious for being extremely specific about character life spans (Genesis 4:17-26 and Genesis 11:10-31), sadly, Eve’s character is seen as so mundane, so irrelevant, that P does not even consider describing her life span. In fact, all of Eve’s actions are presented very matter-of-factly. We hear nothing about her dilemma before she eats the forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:6) or the subsequent asymmetrical pains of childbirth (Genesis 3:16). This feels like a deliberate attempt by the author to dismiss women. He only notes Eve’s contributions when they were too important to ignore. Otherwise, they are just negligible footnotes of a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very basis of Genesis is quite suggestive of the societal tides of change. The flood and the eating of the forbidden fruit of knowledge are both euphemisms for new beginnings, for the act of letting go. They are vivid suggestions of the importance of not getting trapped by dogma. And yet, sadly, the authors of the Bible themselves don’t pay attention to their own lesson: they see women for what they currently are and fail to recognize what they could (and would) become. Eve’s similarities to Pandora signal how strongly she fits the female stereotype, and how much a dystopian society would prefer for women to have no innovative thoughts of their own. She, too, is a caricature of a woman trapped in a tight jar of a body. Her only purpose, to open this jar of humans, to perform “Genesis”. How poetic, then, that “hope”, perhaps the most important element of genesis, was left trapped in Pandora’s jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;penelope&quot;&gt;Penelope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Penelope lives in a society of neglect. Even Athena, a female goddess, thinks that the average woman would steal wealth and resources from her old house and marry another suitor in Penelope’s situation (Homer, &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 15.20). &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Yet, for us, the reader, who has seen Penelope’s perspective, this sounds so uncharacteristic of her, it almost seems like Athena is mocking women. In a society full of neglect, care is the strongest signal of rebellion. She cares about her (possibly dead) soulmate Odysseus. She cares about giving her aging father-in-law an honorable burial (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 2.101). She cares about the plight of the Xenoi, the beggars (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 19.90-100), even when that means defying some of the most decorated warriors/suitors of Ithaca. Unlike Laertes, who is so overcome by grief that he flees to the countryside (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 1.190), Penelope is a strong, free spirit who takes control of her own destiny, and refuses to abide by the impractical ideals of a male-dominated society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, Homer, perhaps as a message to the society, really tries to make sure we note this specialty of Penelope’s nature: Telemachus, describing his mother’s independent nature, says, “She may be clever, but she acts on whims.” (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 19.133) and Agamemnon, too, expresses his jealousy to Odysseus, saying “you got yourself a wife of virtue — great Penelope” (&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, 24.194).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-times-they-are-a-changin&quot;&gt;The Times They Are a-Changin’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the grand scheme of things, these writings actually reflect something deeply ingrained in the society of the time. Eve and Penelope are complementary representations of the zeitgeist of their respective societies and times that signal the “acts of defiance” of the women of Antiquity. They are signals of the upcoming, grander, women’s revolution. It is not that Pandora and Eve are “Manic Pixie Dream Girls” written by asinine writer-directors of Hollywood. Instead, they are representations of the knee-jerk reaction of the patriarchal society to the symptoms of the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Hesiod shares this belief: “You trust a thief when you trust a woman.” (&lt;em&gt;Works and Days&lt;/em&gt;, 375) &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Doriella Du Fontaine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this essay, I look at an old, obscure song &lt;a href=&quot;//youtu.be/OfN9O3Ok85c&quot;&gt;Doriella Du Fontaine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you first hear &lt;em&gt;Doriella Du Fontaine&lt;/em&gt;, it sounds like a run-of-the-mill jam session: first, Jimi sets up a funk groove on his guitar, then as Buddy sets up the beat on the drums, the listener is launched into the tale of Miss Fontaine, told by Lightnin’ Rod in a typical raunchy, vernacular New York style. The song tells a tale of manipulation and fate in a proto-rap spoken word format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track was recorded at the Electric Ladyland, Jimi’s New York studio, in November 1969. While the track was recorded at a time when New York was the beating heart of hip-hop culture, it wasn’t released until years later. Yet, this coincidental jam session went on to influence hip-hop greatly, forming a bridge between the vernacular culture of “toasts” and “dozens” and the modern music industry’s hip-hop. To that end, this piece was so ahead of its time, that writer Gene Santoro described the song as “foreshadow[ing] the rap-meets-metal crossover”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is also notable that the artists assembled at this jam (Buddy Miles, Billy Cox and Larry Young) later became Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, whose work established the early P-funk scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the standalone track &lt;em&gt;Doriella Du Fontaine (DDF)&lt;/em&gt; may seem vanilla compared to the rest of Jalal’s and Hendrix’s discography, which contains countless billboard hits, the historical significance of this piece makes it a gem worth examining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-unlikely-meeting&quot;&gt;An unlikely meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jalal-nuriddin-lightnin-rod&quot;&gt;Jalal Nuriddin (Lightnin’ Rod)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before meeting Jimi, Jalal describes his personal interests as “black music, which was more into Bebop, Blues, Rhythm &amp;amp; Blues, Doo Wop and Afro-Cuban Jazz, with Gospel as my harmonic source point”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In Jalal’s discography, DDF marks a point of transition away from Afro-Cuban instrumentation: from bongos and maracas in his previous tracks (e.g. &lt;em&gt;When the Revolution Comes from The Last Poets&lt;/em&gt;) to jazz/funk instruments like keyboard and bass guitar in his subsequent work (e.g &lt;em&gt;Sport from Hustlers Convention&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jimi-hendrix&quot;&gt;Jimi Hendrix&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jimi first discovered The Last Poets (and Jalal) after hearing their self-titled album pre-release through their shared producer Alan Douglas. The message delivered by their work resonated with Jimi, someone who had attempted to express his own political ideas with music such as his rendition of &lt;em&gt;The Star-Spangled Banner&lt;/em&gt; (the national anthem of the United States)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the massive success of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, in 1968, Jimi looked to expand his music in fresh, new directions. For Jimi Hendrix, DDF was not about money, as he told Jalal, “And I don’t want no money for this, I just want to have fun and jam, so if their [sic] is any money to be made off the track, you and Douglas can work it out.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lyrics&quot;&gt;Lyrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producer Alan Douglas described DDF as a “jail toast”, a mashup of stories Jalal had heard during his time in prison&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. While other early toasts, such as Rudy Ray Moore’s “The Signifying Monkey” restrict themselves to folk tales, there is a clear influence of prisoners’ ideology on DDF: the use of edgy language, normalizing casual drug use, and the underlying idea of a “happily ever after” based on honey trapping or espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lyrics themselves are structured as a casual narration of an incident by Jalal to his friend, Jimi. Jalal seems to be in no hurry, and he paces himself to create a connection to the listener, often calling to his friend (“Jim”/“Jimi”) for a pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poetic elements grow on the listener as well, the beginning of the track has few instances of rhyming words and alliteration, but as we approach the end of the track, the density and variance of the rhymes is much higher: internal rhymes, multi-syllable rhymes and even rhymes across verses, nothing is off-limits for DDF. “Appendix A: an objective look at the lyrics” tries to show a visual representation of this observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spoagraphics&quot;&gt;Spoagraphics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jalal Nuriddin described jail toasts as “spoagraphics” or “spoken pictures”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I think his description of toasts is closely related to the “metaphorical-imagistic” aspect of signification described by scholars Geneva Smitherman, Henry Gates, and Imani Perry&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As Imani Perry puts it, one of the most important reasons to use metaphors and similes in hip-hop is to “engage the imagination and expand or transform the universe in which the MC dwells. With them, the author creates a space of possibility.” Jalal uses the narrative describing the “sunny lands of New Mexico” in verses 11, 12 and 13 to accomplish this in his own way. Moreso, his exaggerated description of his life creates a larger space of possibilities for each subsequent act, making the listener more curious. At the same time, the listener is left with the image of a boasting playboy that is so unrealistic that the very thought of it is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-with-as-nasty-as-they-wanna-be-2-live-crew&quot;&gt;Comparison with &lt;em&gt;As Nasty As They Wanna Be (2 Live Crew)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of obscenity, I think this track is at an interesting crossroads between hip-hop’s vernacular nature and the use of obscenity as a tool for entertainment. While in hindsight, the use of obscenity in this song would be considered mild at best compared to its future counterparts, like 2 Live Crew’s As Nasty As They Wanna Be, it is important to note that the song was recorded in 1970. At the time, Jimi’s audience was largely  “white youth”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and if the song were to be released at the time of recording, I suspect their response would have been harsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I agree with Kimberle Crenshaw’s views on the 2 Live Crew vs. Florida obscenity trial&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, particularly those questioning the value of misogyny and/or racism, even when they are almost inseparable from the cultural history of an ethnic group, I think DDF is a perfect example that describes the “artistic” value of obscenity. DDF treads the fine line between the offensive and the “humorous” quite neatly. There are clear instances of misogyny and boastings of the artist’s sexual prowess, but, unlike 2 Live Crew’s As Nasty As They Wanna Be, they are clear exaggerations of stereotypes and hyperboles. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr. put it in his testimony, they only intend to make the listener “bust out laughing”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, similar to how The Signifying Monkey might have. While it is hard to put into words the differences between the “right” way and the “wrong” way, I think one of the most notable distinctions is that DDF does not rely on misogyny as a crutch for entertainment: Miss Fontaine’s tale is not interesting because of the misogynistic parts, it is interesting despite them. The misogyny only serves to accentuate the highs and the lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;instrumentation&quot;&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DDF’s instrumentals are an original composition featuring Jimi Hendrix on the guitar and Buddy Miles on drums and organ. Notably, the instrumentation production of this track does not seem to be as meticulous as some of Jimi Hendrix’s other works such as &lt;em&gt;All Along the Watchtower (Electric Ladyland)&lt;/em&gt;. For instance, the production doesn’t completely utilize stereophonic audio, adding to the informal jam session aesthetic of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the breaks show the track’s connections with the future of hip-hop, it is interesting to note that the track also uses music as a storytelling tool, a practice more common in past toasts and dozens. Particularly, in verse 13, the absence of background music after “Bulletin: Last night, Dixie Fair …” and in verse 15, a drum roll after “Age 25…” build up suspense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tug-of-war&quot;&gt;The tug-of-war&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the track progresses and the spoken word tale gets more interesting, the guitar and drum breaks become more intricate as well&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; this creates almost a tug of war for the listener’s attention. Visually, this effect can even be seen in the waveform, where breaks later in the track use drums more intentionally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;../assets/ddf-image1.png&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;For more information, please refer to Appendix B.&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the instruments individually contribute a “rock” feel to the song, I believe this tug of war is responsible for the groove/disco feel of the song. Even though the disco scene of New York was in its infancy in 1969, this track manages to capture its essence with the instrumentation creating a sense of urgency and uneasiness during the breaks, but fading to become only an accessory during the “spoagraphic” sections. As Peter Shapiro&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Disco was at once about community and individual pleasure, sensation and alienation, orgy and sacrifice; it promised both liberation and constraint, release and restraint, frivolity and doom. Disco was both utopia and hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;comparison-with-iceberg-slims-rendition&quot;&gt;Comparison with Iceberg Slim’s rendition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1976, as part of his album &lt;em&gt;Reflections&lt;/em&gt;, Iceberg Slim released his 3 part rendition &lt;em&gt;Durealla (Du Fontaine)&lt;/em&gt;. While both tracks had the same origins (as “jail toasts”), Iceberg’s version focuses on the story and the spoken word performance, whereas the Jimi Hendrix/Lightnin’ Rod version is a lot more experimental with the instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a purely lyrical perspective, Iceberg Slim’s toast is superior. There are a lot more intricate rhythms and poetic devices, and his accent and cadence lend themselves to the playboy character beautifully. His recitation is also useful for pointing out some errors in Jalal’s version, for example, Jalal uses “stated” instead of “slated” in verse 15. Iceberg Slim also uses a slightly different narrative structure, using a refrain “Candy, Honey, she said”. Overall, the impromptu jam session feel of the &lt;em&gt;Lightnin’ Rod&lt;/em&gt; rendition is emphasized by the comparison with the &lt;em&gt;Iceberg Slim&lt;/em&gt; rendition, and one might argue that the improvised feeling is at the heart of modern hip-hop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the lack of Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Miles’ assertion for attention is felt quite strongly in the instrumentation. While the jazz/blues music adds a mellow, relaxed vibe to the track, there are no instrumental breaks in this rendition and none of the aforementioned “tug of war” for the listener’s attention. In fact, the jazz instruments just seem to fade away in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-alternate-history&quot;&gt;An alternate history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While studying the origins of the song, I ran into a very interesting forum post&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where users suggested a completely different origin story for the track: one where Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Miles never even met Lightnin’ Rod!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Celluloid Records released a limited repress of DDF. According to user &lt;em&gt;Purple Jim&lt;/em&gt;, the accompanying press release (which, unfortunately, is not accessible anymore) said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The project began in late 1969 with famed producer Alan Douglas recording the unmistakable Jimi Hendrix and legendary Buddy Miles rolling and groove-laden musical backdrop. &lt;strong&gt;Fast forward 4 years and Lightnin’ Rod (aka Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin) adds in his distinctive vocal soundtrack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering this, the user contacted Celluloid Records for their source, who informed him “It was Alan Douglas”. I, too, tried to contact the record label, but have not received a response as of December 2, 2019. It should be noted that it would not be uncharacteristic for producer Alan Douglas to take a jam by Jimi and re-package it as DDF, given his philosophy on remixes and overdubs&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Further, given the legal trouble (and the controversial fan response) surrounding his production of posthumous releases, it may have been in his best interests to hide the true origins of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I personally think that the vocals and music are too tightly integrated for DDF to be an overdub of a prerecorded instrumental track. Besides, I find that there is almost too much evidence supporting the idea that the recording is indeed a casual jam session involving all three artists, from the personal account by Jalaluddin Nuriddin&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to books such as “Ultimate Hendrix: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Live Concerts and Sessions”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; elaborating the context of the jam session in excruciating levels of detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the possibility is quite intriguing, and the story is too interesting to be left out of a historical account of the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;appendix-a-an-objective-look-at-the-lyrics&quot;&gt;Appendix A: An objective look at the lyrics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a number of different transcriptions of DDF are available on websites such as Genius.com&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and fandom.com&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, they seem to be very inaccurate. While tracing the source of these inaccuracies, I found that most of the errors follow from the same source: a supplemental booklet for the album The prime time rhyme of The Last Poets&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I have listed my transcription of the lyrics, based on my own interpretation and analysis of the toast. For visual representation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rhyming words in the same verse are highlighted with similar colors,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Underlined syllables show alliteration and,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paragraph breaks signify an instrumental break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was standing on the corner in the middle of the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;square&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
Tryin’ to make me some arrangements to get some of that dynamite reefer &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;there&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Now, I was already &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;high&lt;/span&gt;, and dressed very &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;fly&lt;/span&gt;, just &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;standin’&lt;/span&gt; on the corner &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;watchin’&lt;/span&gt; all the fine hoes. &lt;br /&gt;
When up drove my &lt;u&gt;main man Vann&lt;/u&gt; in his super ninety-eight olds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as Vann stepped out the cat, he looked about to me, and began to &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;speak&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
When with a &lt;u&gt;sexy stride&lt;/u&gt;, out from the other side, stepped this real fine &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;freak&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now she wore a black chemise &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;dress&lt;/span&gt; which was considered to be one of the very &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;best&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Her hair was glossy black and eyes a deep sea &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;green-blue&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
And her skin was a boss dark &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;hue&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Man! She was some kind of fine! &lt;br /&gt;
Now, as I spoke to &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;Vann&lt;/span&gt;, and I shook his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;hand&lt;/span&gt;, and I asked him “Was that his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;honey&lt;/span&gt;?” &lt;br /&gt;
Without no jive, this was the dude’s reply, &lt;br /&gt;
“Like she’s anybody’s who wants to make some &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;money&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said “She’s really down and known all around as Miss Doriella Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
She plays her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;sick&lt;/span&gt; mind and she’s &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;slick&lt;/span&gt;, and she’s one of the best in the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;game&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
This girl was no &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;jerk&lt;/span&gt; cause I’ve seen her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;, she’s nice and she can use her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
And she’s good with her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;crack&lt;/span&gt; from a long way’s &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;back&lt;/span&gt;, and she’s done made me a whole lot of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;bread&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Vann was sporting a Panama &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;Straw&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
had a Corona-el-producto stuck out the side of his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;jaw&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
He wore a beige silk suit that looked &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;real silky&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
He was dressed to make Rockefeller &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;feel guilty&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Now I was &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;dressed&lt;/span&gt;, I must &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;confess&lt;/span&gt;, although I couldn’t compare with &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;Vann&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
It’s not that his taste is better than mine, it’s just that he’s the big money &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;man&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hey, fellas,” Doriella said,  &lt;br /&gt;
“I’m as starving as can be. How about a bite to &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;eat&lt;/span&gt;?” &lt;br /&gt;
So we all &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;agreed&lt;/span&gt; on a &lt;u&gt;fabulous &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;feed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, down at the Waldorf up on the big &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;street&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Now the Waldorf was glowing in bright neon &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;light&lt;/span&gt;, although this was my first &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;flight&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
We were all clean as the board of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;health&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Three players, that’s &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;, in rainbows of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;, and we painted a picture of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;wealth&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as we were &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;dining&lt;/span&gt;, Vann started &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;unwinding&lt;/span&gt;, and he began to run his mouth off to me. &lt;br /&gt;
But as we left, I dug his woman, Miss Du Fontaine, was steadily pinning on me &lt;br /&gt;
“Hey fellow,” Doriella &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
“Since we met I’m &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;glad&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
So here’s the address to my &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;br /&gt;
So next Saturday I got real fly, and I went to see Miss Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
I stopped off at my main man &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/span&gt;, this dude deals with &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;snow&lt;/span&gt;, and I copped me some &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;cocaine&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now as I got to her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;, Jimi it was some kind of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;br /&gt;
It was really a bar &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;br /&gt;
She had a 5-inch &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;carpet&lt;/span&gt;, which was limited in a &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;market&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere from the far-East Orient. &lt;br /&gt;
The hi-fi was &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;sailin’&lt;/span&gt; and I wasn’t &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;failing&lt;/span&gt;, but I just couldn’t rap to this &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;queen&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
She dug my feet was &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;cold&lt;/span&gt; and took a tight &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;hold&lt;/span&gt; and gave me some pot, Chicago &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
She said, “You be my &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;man&lt;/span&gt; and together we’ll trick the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;land&lt;/span&gt;, and I’ll be your true-blue &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;bitch&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
and &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;although&lt;/span&gt; you’ll have to show me to those other squares, like I’ll take their &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;dough&lt;/span&gt; and make you &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;br /&gt;
Now you know where I’m &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;at&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;br /&gt;
I really went for &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
And I put this fine hoe in her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;bed&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;Me&lt;/span&gt; and this queen made love &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;supreme&lt;/span&gt;, and I flipped when she gave me some &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, next Saturday around &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;, we was out having &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;, at the club known as the Island of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Joy&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
When in walked Dixie &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;Fair&lt;/span&gt;, Drugstore &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;millionaire&lt;/span&gt;, International &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;playboy&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
“Hey, fella,” Dixie &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
“Who’s that fine model in &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;br /&gt;
Why I’ll give you a &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;fee&lt;/span&gt;, if you introduce her to &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;.” &lt;br /&gt;
So I did, and my woman, &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;, she did the rest. &lt;br /&gt;
Now, Next morning in &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;bed&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
“Of course honey,’ she &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
“I can take Dixie out for all his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;bread&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But like you got to wait patiently, like a hustler on the sunny lands of New Mexico. &lt;br /&gt;
Because I don’t want you around when I take off this clown, and I get him hung up in my den. &lt;br /&gt;
But when I pull through, baby I’ll come straight to you, and you’ll never have to hustle again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next morning, I jumped in my $500 dollar grey silk &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;vine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I downed me a pint of ice cold &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;wine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
I snatched my &lt;u&gt;black bank book&lt;/u&gt;, and I made reservations on TWA &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;airline&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Now, my stay wasn’t &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
I had a fabulous &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;pad&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
I pulled plenty of fabulous &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;hoes&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
I pulled Miss Carmen &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Vista&lt;/span&gt;, who was huge in the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Keister&lt;/span&gt;, and first cousin to Mexicali &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;Rose&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Now, the climate was &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;hot&lt;/span&gt;, and there was plenty of &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;pot&lt;/span&gt;, and the tequila’s were &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;dynamite&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
As I laid my shot on top of Carmen’s back, and she was on her knees all &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;night&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now one morning, &lt;br /&gt;
As I patiently &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;waited&lt;/span&gt;, I got a telegram that &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
It said, “Papa daddy, I made a real grand slam. &lt;br /&gt;
I’m on my &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;way&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;TWA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Comet’ number 3. &lt;br /&gt;
I’ll be in New Mexico by &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;four&lt;/span&gt;, I can’t say no &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Love, your fine woman D”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmen then gave me a bath in ice cold &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;milk&lt;/span&gt;, and I jumped in my $500 dollar grey &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;silk&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
and downed me a &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;pint&lt;/span&gt; of ice-cold &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;wine&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
when I dug the New York news,  that shook me in my shoes with its bold daring &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;headline&lt;/span&gt;… &lt;br /&gt;
It said, “Bulletin: Last night, Dixie &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;Fair&lt;/span&gt;… drug store &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;millionaire&lt;/span&gt;, committed &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;suicide&lt;/span&gt;… &lt;br /&gt;
Left all his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;fame&lt;/span&gt; to Miss Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#a8e6cf;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;, stated to be his &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;bride&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jim, I made a beeline on down to the airport, just in time to hear the announcer say, &lt;br /&gt;
“Attention in the lobby, Attention in Lobby: &lt;br /&gt;
Relatives and friends of passengers on Comet’ number 3, &lt;br /&gt;
Wait no longer, for in fate’s cruel hands, the good Comet has &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;crashed&lt;/span&gt; off the coast known as Chili &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#dcedc1;&quot;&gt;Sands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! The rescuers said that there was a woman alive! &lt;br /&gt;
Age 25… &lt;br /&gt;
Hair glossy black… &lt;br /&gt;
Eyes a deep sea &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;green-blue&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
Skin a boss dark &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd3b6;&quot;&gt;hue&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
She said she was on her &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;way&lt;/span&gt; to her fine man in &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffaaa5;&quot;&gt;grey&lt;/span&gt;, stated to be his bride. &lt;br /&gt;
She would have been his true-blue &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;bitch&lt;/span&gt;, and would’ve made him &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e4dcf1;&quot;&gt;rich&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
but Jim she &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;coughed&lt;/span&gt; up blood and &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#bdeaee;&quot;&gt;died&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh lord! That hurt me &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;br /&gt;
But I pulled &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;through&lt;/span&gt;, like all damned stud’s &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#e3f0ff;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;
But I know I’ll never be the &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Cause there’ll never be another Miss Doriella Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
That’s her name, Miss Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
That’s her name, Miss Du &lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#fff6e9;&quot;&gt;Fontaine&lt;/span&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to discover intricate patterns in the breaks, I used the software Audacity to isolate all the breaks and verses of the track. While it did not aid me much, it is still useful to be able to hear the lyrics and the breaks independently: &lt;a href=&quot;//www.dropbox.com/s/dw5spkq4rigbgzm/DDF.aup&quot;&gt;file&lt;/a&gt;. To open the project, please use the free open-source software &lt;a href=&quot;//www.audacityteam.org&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Analysing Image Dithering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=image-dithering-cover.gif&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;image dithering cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, as part of the Wolfram High School Summer Camp program, I decided to do a project analysing image dithering, and the various ways to do it. Over the course of two weeks, I learnt and understood how the algorithms work. Since resources about this process are sparse on the internet, in this post, I not only implement the algorithms, but additionally describe in detail what image dithering is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of my project was to use machine learning to classify images that originate from different image dithering algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After failing to get high accuracy with a large number of machine learning techniques, I finally came up with one that has an &lt;strong&gt;accuracy of about 90%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this community post is an adapted version of my computational essay. &lt;em&gt;My computational essay is attached at the bottom of the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-image-dithering&quot;&gt;What is image dithering?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at3.50.44PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;image-dithering-FS-example&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you tell the difference between the two images above?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image on the right uses &lt;strong&gt;just 24 colours&lt;/strong&gt; .
Yet, using Floyd-Steinberg dithering, it manages to look as detailed and beautiful as the one on the left, which is using more than 16 million colours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’ s formally define what the aim of image dithering is :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an RGB image with \(256^3\) colors, reduce the colour space of the image to only belong to a certain color palette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at4.11.46PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;chromaticity-plot comparison&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the chromaticity plots of the above images&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;color-palette&quot;&gt;Color Palette&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let us tackle the easier problem at hand. Say that we are given the option to choose our color palette, the only restriction being the number of colours in the palette. What would be the best way to obtain a color palette that is the most appropriate for an image?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the Wolfram Language makes this task very easy for us, as we can simply use the inbuilt function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DominantColors[image, n]&lt;/code&gt;. For example, regarding the image above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at4.15.27PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;dominant-colors of the image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would be the most appropriate color palette with 12 colours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some visualisations of the process of choosing the color palette in 3D RGB space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color palette of the original image:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=color-palette-og.gif&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;original color palette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color palette of the dithered image:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=color-palette-final.gif&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;final color palette&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice how the final color palette is quite close to points on the diagonal of the cube. I go into a lot more detail about this in my computational essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, let us try to solve the main part of the problem, actually figuring out the mapping of a pixel colour to its new colour.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;naive-idea&quot;&gt;Naive idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;colorPallete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;96&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;159&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;191&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;223&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at4.19.57PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;grid naive idea&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;extra&quot;&gt;Extra!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to implement my own (but slower) version of the Wolfram function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nearest&lt;/code&gt; for the final functions, since pre-compiling Wolfram code to C code does not support &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nearest&lt;/code&gt; natively.
However, at the time of writing, I have heard that there is an internal project going on in Wolfram to enable support for compiling all inbuilt Wolfram function to C natively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;better-idea&quot;&gt;Better idea&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one can guess, this idea can be improved a lot. One of the important ideas is that of “smoothing”. We want the transition between two objects/colours to look smoother. One way to do that would be make a gradient as the transition occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, how do you formalise a “gradient”? And how do you make a smooth one when all you have are 24 colours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dithering basically attempts to solves these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve our questions, let’s think about a pixel: what’s the best way to make it look closest to its original colour?
In the naive idea, we created some error by rounding to some nearby values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each pixel, let’s formalise the error as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at4.23.38PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;error in pixel[1, 1] screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;error-diffusion&quot;&gt;Error diffusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the error should somehow be transmitted to the neighbouring elements so we can account for the error in a pixel in its neighbours. To maintain an even order of processing, let us assume that we will traverse the 2D array of pixels from the top-left corner, row-wise until we reach the bottom-right corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it never makes sense to “push” the effects of an error to a cell we’ve already processed. Finally, let us see some ways to actually diffuse the error across the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;floyd---steinberg-dithering&quot;&gt;Floyd - Steinberg Dithering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Robert Floyd and Louis Steinberg published the most popular dithering algorithm&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The pattern for error diffusion can be described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;diffusionFormula&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;diffusionPosition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-mean&quot;&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionFormula&lt;/code&gt; is simply a way to encode the diffusion from a pixel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionPosition&lt;/code&gt; refers to the position of the pixel, relative to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionFormula&lt;/code&gt; encoding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, an error of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; at pixel &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;{1, 1}&lt;/code&gt;  translates to the following additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;pixel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;pixel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to the other dithering algorithms here, Atkinson’s algorithm diffuses a lot less of the error to its surroundings. It tends to preserve detail well, but very continuous sections of colours appear blown out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was made by Bill Atkinson&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, an Apple employee.The pattern for error diffusion is as below :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download my computational essay to see it in action. Alternately, use the functions  in the “Implementation” section to evaluate the code. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;im1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;im2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;im3&lt;/code&gt; can be replaced by images. I have submitted the comparison to &lt;a href=&quot;http://demonstrations.wolfram.com&quot;&gt;Wolfram Demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; as well, so it should be available online soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;side-note&quot;&gt;Side-note&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the denominator in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionFormula&lt;/code&gt; of a number of algorithms is a power of \(2\)?
This is because division by a power of 2 is equivalent to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/141873&quot;&gt;bit-shifting&lt;/a&gt; the number to the right by \(\log_{2}(divisor)\) bits, making it much faster than division by any other number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the improvements in computer hardware, this is not a major concern anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;come-up-with-your-own-dithering-algorithm&quot;&gt;Come up with your own dithering algorithm!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the dithering algorithms are almost the same as each other(especially the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionPosition&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have made my functions so that you can just tweak the input arguments &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionFormula&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;diffusionPosition&lt;/code&gt;, and test out your own functions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one I tried:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-13at5.03.37PM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;my own dithering algorithm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I will discuss the Wolfram implementation, and some of the features and functions I used in my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;applydithering&quot;&gt;applyDithering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s probably the least interesting part of the algorithm, actually applying the dithering is the most important part of the algorithm, and the one that gave me the most trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off by writing it in the functional paradigm. With little knowledge of Wolfram, I stumbled through the docs to assemble pieces of the code. Finally, I had a “working” version of the algorithm, but there was a major problem: A \(512\cdot512\) RGB image took 700 seconds for processing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This number is way too large for an algorithm with linear time complexity in the size of input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixes&quot;&gt;Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the trivial fixes involved making more use of inbuilt functions(for example, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nearest&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest problem is that the Wolfram notebook is an interpreter, not a compiler. It interprets code every time it’s run.
So the obvious step to optimising performance was using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Compile&lt;/code&gt; function in Wolfram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, there’s a catch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;R1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;MainEvaluate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Hold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;R1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;R6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;R2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;I20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;R1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see something like the above in your machine code, your code is likely to be slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainEvaluate&lt;/code&gt; basically means that the compiled function is calling back the kernel, which too, is a slow process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To view the human readable form of your compiled Wolfram function, you can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;CompiledFunctionTools`&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CompilePrint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;yourFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this, you need to basically write everything in a procedural form using loops and similar constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RuntimeOptions -&amp;gt; &quot;Speed&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which trades off some integer overflow checks etc. for a faster runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the complete code for the function below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;applyDithering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;diffusionList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Real&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;classifying-images&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classifying images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of my project involves classifying dithered images and mapping them to the algorithm they were obtained from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a relatively easy task for machine learning, but it turned out to be much harder. Besides, no similar research on image “metadata” has existed before, which made the task more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up creating a model which has an &lt;strong&gt;accuracy of more than 90%&lt;/strong&gt;, which is reasonably good for machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are uninterested in the failures encountered and the details of the dataset used, please skip ahead to the section on “ResNet-50 with preprocessing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dataset&quot;&gt;Dataset&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain data, I did a web search for images with a keyword chosen randomly from a dictionary of common words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images obtained are then run through the five algorithms I implemented and is stored as the training data. This is to ensure that the images aren’t distinguished much in terms of their actual contents, since that would interfere with learning about the dithering algorithms used in the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images were allowed to use up to 24 colours which are auto-selected, as described in the section on “Color Palette”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the code for downloading, applying the dithering, and re-storing the images. Note that it is not designed with re-usability in mind, these are just snippets coded at the speed of thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some more variable definitions and metadata about the dataset that is referenced in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-14at1.11.09AM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;dataset metadata&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;plain-resnet-50&quot;&gt;Plain ResNet-50&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was to use a popular neural net named “ResNet-50 Trained on ImageNet Competition Data,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and retrain it on my training data.
One of the major reasons for choosing this architecture was that it identifies the main object in an image very accurately, and is quite deep. Both these properties seemed very suitable for my use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the results turned out to be very poor. When I noticed this during the training session, I stopped the process early on. It can be speculated that the poor results were because it was trying to infer relations between the colours in the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;border-classification&quot;&gt;Border classification&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the borders in an image are least affected by the image dithering algorithm, and simply rounded to the closest colours, it should be easier to learn the constants of the diffusionFormula from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can pre-process an image and only use its border pixels for classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bordernet&quot;&gt;borderNet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the aforementioned fact, I implemented a neural net which tried to work with just the borders of the image. This decreased the size of the data to \(512 \cdot 4\) per image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bordernet-with-just-left-and-top-border&quot;&gt;borderNet with just left and top border&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my implementation of the dithering algorithms starts by applying the algorithm from the top-left corner, the pattern in the left and top borders should be even easier for the net to learn. However, this decreased the size of the data even more to \(512 \cdot 2\) per image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the nets failed to work very well, and had &lt;strong&gt;accuracies of around 20%&lt;/strong&gt;. This was probably the case because of the lack of data for the net to actually train well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfram code for the net follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;row-and-column-specific-classification&quot;&gt;Row and column specific classification&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim with this approach was to first make the neural net infer patterns in the columns of the image, then combine that information and observe patterns in the rows of the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn’t work very well either. The major reason for the failure was probably that the diffusion is not really as independent as the net might assume it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;row-and-column-combined-classification&quot;&gt;Row and column combined classification&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the results of Section 2.5, the right method to do the processing seemed to be to use two separate chains, and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CatenateLayer&lt;/code&gt; to combine the results.
For understanding the architecture, observe the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NetGraph&lt;/code&gt; object below:

&lt;p&gt;The Wolfram language code for the net is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Input&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Output&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;NetDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Class&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this net didn’t work very well either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net had a somewhat unconventional architecture, and the excessive parameter count crashed the Wolfram kernel, so they had to be cut down.
Ultimately, it only managed to get an &lt;strong&gt;accuracy rate of around 25-30%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;resnet-50-with-preprocessing&quot;&gt;ResNet-50 with preprocessing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final idea was to use pre-processing to our advantage. Dithering, in its essence, shifts the error downward and towards the right. Therefore, one way to filter the image would be to pad the image with one row of pixels at the top and one column at the left, and subtracting the padded image from the original one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what that looks like:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-14at1.24.56AM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;FS image preprocessing for net&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for doing this to an image is as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-mathematica&quot; data-lang=&quot;mathematica&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ImageTake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ImagePad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;512&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notice how the image(right side, after processing) resembles the parts with the “checkerboard” pattern described in the section “How does one come up with these weird constants?” under “Floyd - Steinberg Dithering” .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason this net works well is that, even with same color palettes, the gradient of the images coming from dithering algorithms is quite different. This is because of the differences in the error diffusion, and by subtracting the padded image from the original image, we obtain a filtered version of the dithering patterns, making it easy for the neural net to spot them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net was trained on AWS for more than 7 hours, on a larger dataset of 1500 images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results outperformed my expectations, and on a test-set of more than 700 images, 300 of which were part of the original training data, it showed an &lt;strong&gt;accuracy rate of nearly 91%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://community.wolfram.com//c/portal/getImageAttachment?filename=ScreenShot2018-07-14at1.28.45AM.png&amp;amp;userId=1371661&quot; alt=&quot;classifier measurement object&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a code of the net with details:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Output&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;NetDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Class&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;classes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it’s just the &lt;strong&gt;ResNet - 50&lt;/strong&gt; modified to work with \(512 \cdot 512\) images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;Future Work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look into using machine learning for un-dithering an image.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look into creating new dithering algorithms that perform faster or better than the existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All images and visualisations in this post were generated in Wolfram. Their code may be seen in the computational essay attached below.&lt;/p&gt;
