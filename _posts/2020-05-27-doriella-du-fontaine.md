_This essay was written for a class, and is reproduced here as-is._

When you first hear _Doriella Du Fontaine_, it sounds like a run-of-the-mill jam session: first, Jimi sets up a funk groove on his guitar, then as Buddy sets up the beat on the drums, the listener is launched into the tale of Miss Fontaine, told by Lightnin’ Rod in a typical raunchy, vernacular New York style. The song tells a tale of manipulation and fate in a proto-rap spoken word format.

The track was recorded at the Electric Ladyland, Jimi’s New York studio, in November 1969. While the track was recorded at a time when New York was the beating heart of hip-hop culture, it wasn’t released until years later. Yet, this coincidental jam session went on to influence hip-hop greatly, forming a bridge between the vernacular culture of “toasts” and “dozens” and the modern music industry’s hip-hop. To that end, this piece was so ahead of its time, that writer Gene Santoro described the song as "foreshadow[ing] the rap-meets-metal crossover"[^1]. It is also notable that the artists assembled at this jam (Buddy Miles, Billy Cox and Larry Young) later became Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys[^2], whose work established the early P-funk scene.

While the standalone track _Doriella Du Fontaine (DDF)_ may seem vanilla compared to the rest of Jalal’s and Hendrix’s discography, which contains countless billboard hits, the historical significance of this piece makes it a gem worth examining.

## An unlikely meeting

### Jalal Nuriddin (Lightnin’ Rod)

Before meeting Jimi, Jalal describes his personal interests as “black music, which was more into Bebop, Blues, Rhythm & Blues, Doo Wop and Afro-Cuban Jazz, with Gospel as my harmonic source point”[^2]. In Jalal’s discography, DDF marks a point of transition away from Afro-Cuban instrumentation: from bongos and maracas in his previous tracks (e.g. _When the Revolution Comes from The Last Poets_) to jazz/funk instruments like keyboard and bass guitar in his subsequent work (e.g _Sport from Hustlers Convention_).

### Jimi Hendrix[^2]

Jimi first discovered The Last Poets (and Jalal) after hearing their self-titled album pre-release through their shared producer Alan Douglas. The message delivered by their work resonated with Jimi, someone who had attempted to express his own political ideas with music such as his rendition of _The Star-Spangled Banner_ (the national anthem of the United States)[^3].

After the massive success of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, in 1968, Jimi looked to expand his music in fresh, new directions. For Jimi Hendrix, DDF was not about money, as he told Jalal, “And I don't want no money for this, I just want to have fun and jam, so if their [sic] is any money to be made off the track, you and Douglas can work it out.”[^2]

## Lyrics

Producer Alan Douglas described DDF as a “jail toast”, a mashup of stories Jalal had heard during his time in prison[^7]. While other early toasts, such as Rudy Ray Moore’s “The Signifying Monkey” restrict themselves to folk tales, there is a clear influence of prisoners’ ideology on DDF: the use of edgy language, normalizing casual drug use, and the underlying idea of a “happily ever after” based on honey trapping or espionage.

The lyrics themselves are structured as a casual narration of an incident by Jalal to his friend, Jimi. Jalal seems to be in no hurry, and he paces himself to create a connection to the listener, often calling to his friend (“Jim”/“Jimi”) for a pause.

The poetic elements grow on the listener as well, the beginning of the track has few instances of rhyming words and alliteration, but as we approach the end of the track, the density and variance of the rhymes is much higher: internal rhymes, multi-syllable rhymes and even rhymes across verses, nothing is off-limits for DDF. “Appendix A: an objective look at the lyrics” tries to show a visual representation of this observation.

### Spoagraphics

Jalal Nuriddin described jail toasts as “spoagraphics” or “spoken pictures”[^7]. I think his description of toasts is closely related to the “metaphorical-imagistic” aspect of signification described by scholars Geneva Smitherman, Henry Gates, and Imani Perry[^8]. As Imani Perry puts it, one of the most important reasons to use metaphors and similes in hip-hop is to “engage the imagination and expand or transform the universe in which the MC dwells. With them, the author creates a space of possibility.” Jalal uses the narrative describing the “sunny lands of New Mexico” in verses 11, 12 and 13 to accomplish this in his own way. Moreso, his exaggerated description of his life creates a larger space of possibilities for each subsequent act, making the listener more curious. At the same time, the listener is left with the image of a boasting playboy that is so unrealistic that the very thought of it is entertaining.

### Comparison with _As Nasty As They Wanna Be (2 Live Crew)_

From the perspective of obscenity, I think this track is at an interesting crossroads between hip-hop’s vernacular nature and the use of obscenity as a tool for entertainment. While in hindsight, the use of obscenity in this song would be considered mild at best compared to its future counterparts, like 2 Live Crew’s As Nasty As They Wanna Be, it is important to note that the song was recorded in 1970. At the time, Jimi’s audience was largely  “white youth”[^2] and if the song were to be released at the time of recording, I suspect their response would have been harsh.

While I agree with Kimberle Crenshaw's views on the 2 Live Crew vs. Florida obscenity trial[^9], particularly those questioning the value of misogyny and/or racism, even when they are almost inseparable from the cultural history of an ethnic group, I think DDF is a perfect example that describes the "artistic" value of obscenity. DDF treads the fine line between the offensive and the "humorous" quite neatly. There are clear instances of misogyny and boastings of the artist's sexual prowess, but, unlike 2 Live Crew's As Nasty As They Wanna Be, they are clear exaggerations of stereotypes and hyperboles. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr. put it in his testimony, they only intend to make the listener "bust out laughing"[^10], similar to how The Signifying Monkey might have. While it is hard to put into words the differences between the "right" way and the "wrong" way, I think one of the most notable distinctions is that DDF does not rely on misogyny as a crutch for entertainment: Miss Fontaine's tale is not interesting because of the misogynistic parts, it is interesting despite them. The misogyny only serves to accentuate the highs and the lows.

## Instrumentation

DDF’s instrumentals are an original composition featuring Jimi Hendrix on the guitar and Buddy Miles on drums and organ. Notably, the instrumentation production of this track does not seem to be as meticulous as some of Jimi Hendrix’s other works such as _All Along the Watchtower (Electric Ladyland)_. For instance, the production doesn’t completely utilize stereophonic audio, adding to the informal jam session aesthetic of the track.

While the breaks show the track’s connections with the future of hip-hop, it is interesting to note that the track also uses music as a storytelling tool, a practice more common in past toasts and dozens. Particularly, in verse 13, the absence of background music after “Bulletin: Last night, Dixie Fair …” and in verse 15, a drum roll after “Age 25…” build up suspense.

### The tug-of-war

As the track progresses and the spoken word tale gets more interesting, the guitar and drum breaks become more intricate as well[^11]; this creates almost a tug of war for the listener’s attention. Visually, this effect can even be seen in the waveform, where breaks later in the track use drums more intentionally:

  The break at 0:29 primarily relies on guitar riffs

  <i>
  The break at 4:46 has drums playing throughout
  </i>
  </p>

  <i>For more information, please refer to Appendix B.</i>
  </p>
</p>


While the instruments individually contribute a “rock” feel to the song, I believe this tug of war is responsible for the groove/disco feel of the song. Even though the disco scene of New York was in its infancy in 1969, this track manages to capture its essence with the instrumentation creating a sense of urgency and uneasiness during the breaks, but fading to become only an accessory during the “spoagraphic” sections. As Peter Shapiro[^12] puts it:

> Disco was at once about community and individual pleasure, sensation and alienation, orgy and sacrifice; it promised both liberation and constraint, release and restraint, frivolity and doom. Disco was both utopia and hell.

## Comparison with Iceberg Slim’s rendition

In 1976, as part of his album _Reflections_, Iceberg Slim released his 3 part rendition _Durealla (Du Fontaine)_. While both tracks had the same origins (as “jail toasts”), Iceberg’s version focuses on the story and the spoken word performance, whereas the Jimi Hendrix/Lightnin’ Rod version is a lot more experimental with the instruments.

From a purely lyrical perspective, Iceberg Slim’s toast is superior. There are a lot more intricate rhythms and poetic devices, and his accent and cadence lend themselves to the playboy character beautifully. His recitation is also useful for pointing out some errors in Jalal’s version, for example, Jalal uses “stated” instead of “slated” in verse 15. Iceberg Slim also uses a slightly different narrative structure, using a refrain “Candy, Honey, she said”. Overall, the impromptu jam session feel of the _Lightnin’ Rod_ rendition is emphasized by the comparison with the _Iceberg Slim_ rendition, and one might argue that the improvised feeling is at the heart of modern hip-hop.

However, the lack of Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Miles’ assertion for attention is felt quite strongly in the instrumentation. While the jazz/blues music adds a mellow, relaxed vibe to the track, there are no instrumental breaks in this rendition and none of the aforementioned “tug of war” for the listener’s attention. In fact, the jazz instruments just seem to fade away in the background.

## An alternate history

While studying the origins of the song, I ran into a very interesting forum post[^4] where users suggested a completely different origin story for the track: one where Jimi Hendrix and Buddy Miles never even met Lightnin' Rod!

In 2011, Celluloid Records released a limited repress of DDF. According to user _Purple Jim_, the accompanying press release (which, unfortunately, is not accessible anymore) said:

> The project began in late 1969 with famed producer Alan Douglas recording the unmistakable Jimi Hendrix and legendary Buddy Miles rolling and groove-laden musical backdrop. **Fast forward 4 years and Lightnin' Rod (aka Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin) adds in his distinctive vocal soundtrack.**

After discovering this, the user contacted Celluloid Records for their source, who informed him “It was Alan Douglas”. I, too, tried to contact the record label, but have not received a response as of December 2, 2019. It should be noted that it would not be uncharacteristic for producer Alan Douglas to take a jam by Jimi and re-package it as DDF, given his philosophy on remixes and overdubs[^5]. Further, given the legal trouble (and the controversial fan response) surrounding his production of posthumous releases, it may have been in his best interests to hide the true origins of the track.

Yet, I personally think that the vocals and music are too tightly integrated for DDF to be an overdub of a prerecorded instrumental track. Besides, I find that there is almost too much evidence supporting the idea that the recording is indeed a casual jam session involving all three artists, from the personal account by Jalaluddin Nuriddin[^2] to books such as "Ultimate Hendrix: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Live Concerts and Sessions"[^6] elaborating the context of the jam session in excruciating levels of detail.

Nonetheless, the possibility is quite intriguing, and the story is too interesting to be left out of a historical account of the track.

## Appendix A: An objective look at the lyrics

While a number of different transcriptions of DDF are available on websites such as Genius.com[^13] and fandom.com[^14], they seem to be very inaccurate. While tracing the source of these inaccuracies, I found that most of the errors follow from the same source: a supplemental booklet for the album The prime time rhyme of The Last Poets[^15].

Below, I have listed my transcription of the lyrics, based on my own interpretation and analysis of the toast. For visual representation:

- Rhyming words in the same verse are highlighted with similar colors,
- Underlined syllables show alliteration and,
- Paragraph breaks signify an instrumental break.

I was standing on the corner in the middle of the <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">square</span>, <br>
Tryin' to make me some arrangements to get some of that dynamite reefer <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">there</span>. <br>
Now, I was already <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">high</span>, and dressed very <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">fly</span>, just <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">standin'</span> on the corner <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">watchin'</span> all the fine hoes. <br>
When up drove my <u>main man Vann</u> in his super ninety-eight olds.

Now as Vann stepped out the cat, he looked about to me, and began to <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">speak</span>, <br>
When with a <u>sexy stride</u>, out from the other side, stepped this real fine <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">freak</span>.

Now she wore a black chemise <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">dress</span> which was considered to be one of the very <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">best</span>. <br>
Her hair was glossy black and eyes a deep sea <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">green-blue</span>, <br>
And her skin was a boss dark <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">hue</span>. <br>
Man! She was some kind of fine! <br>
Now, as I spoke to <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">Vann</span>, and I shook his <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">hand</span>, and I asked him "Was that his <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">honey</span>?" <br>
Without no jive, this was the dude's reply, <br>
"Like she's anybody's who wants to make some <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">money</span>."

He said "She's really down and known all around as Miss Doriella Du <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">Fontaine</span>. <br>
She plays her <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">sick</span> mind and she's <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">slick</span>, and she's one of the best in the <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">game</span>. <br>
This girl was no <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">jerk</span> cause I've seen her <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">work</span>, she's nice and she can use her <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">head</span>. <br>
And she's good with her <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">crack</span> from a long way's <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">back</span>, and she's done made me a whole lot of <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">bread</span>."

Now, Vann was sporting a Panama <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">Straw</span>, <br>
had a Corona-el-producto stuck out the side of his <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">jaw</span>. <br>
He wore a beige silk suit that looked <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">real silky</span>, <br>
He was dressed to make Rockefeller <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">feel guilty</span>. <br>
Now I was <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">dressed</span>, I must <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">confess</span>, although I couldn't compare with <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">Vann</span>, <br>
It's not that his taste is better than mine, it's just that he's the big money <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">man</span>.

"Hey, fellas," Doriella said,  <br>
"I'm as starving as can be. How about a bite to <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">eat</span>?" <br>
So we all <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">agreed</span> on a <u>fabulous <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">feed</span></u>, down at the Waldorf up on the big <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">street</span> <br>
Now the Waldorf was glowing in bright neon <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">light</span>, although this was my first <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">flight</span>, <br>
We were all clean as the board of <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">health</span>. <br>
Three players, that's <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">true</span>, in rainbows of <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">blue</span>, and we painted a picture of <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">wealth</span>.

Now as we were <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">dining</span>, Vann started <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">unwinding</span>, and he began to run his mouth off to me. <br>
But as we left, I dug his woman, Miss Du Fontaine, was steadily pinning on me <br>
"Hey fellow," Doriella <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">said</span>, <br>
"Since we met I'm <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">glad</span>, <br>
So here's the address to my <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">pad</span>." <br>
So next Saturday I got real fly, and I went to see Miss Du <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">Fontaine</span>. <br>
I stopped off at my main man <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">Joe</span>, this dude deals with <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">snow</span>, and I copped me some <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">cocaine</span>.

Now as I got to her <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">pad</span>, Jimi it was some kind of <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">bad</span>! <br>
It was really a bar <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">set</span>.  <br>
She had a 5-inch <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">carpet</span>, which was limited in a <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">market</span> <br>
Somewhere from the far-East Orient. <br>
The hi-fi was <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">sailin'</span> and I wasn't <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">failing</span>, but I just couldn't rap to this <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">queen</span>. <br>
She dug my feet was <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">cold</span> and took a tight <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">hold</span> and gave me some pot, Chicago <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">Green</span>. <br>
She said, "You be my <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">man</span> and together we'll trick the <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">land</span>, and I'll be your true-blue <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">bitch</span>, <br>
and <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">although</span> you'll have to show me to those other squares, like I'll take their <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">dough</span> and make you <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">rich</span>." <br>
Now you know where I'm <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">at</span>! <br>
I really went for <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">that</span>. <br>
And I put this fine hoe in her <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">bed</span>. <br>
<span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">Me</span> and this queen made love <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">supreme</span>, and I flipped when she gave me some <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">head</span>.

Now, next Saturday around <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">one</span>, we was out having <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">fun</span>, at the club known as the Island of <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Joy</span>, <br>
When in walked Dixie <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">Fair</span>, Drugstore <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">millionaire</span>, International <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">playboy</span>. <br>
"Hey, fella," Dixie <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">said</span>, <br>
"Who's that fine model in <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">red</span>? <br>
Why I'll give you a <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">fee</span>, if you introduce her to <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">me</span>." <br>
So I did, and my woman, <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">D</span>, she did the rest. <br>
Now, Next morning in <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">bed</span>, <br>
"Of course honey,' she <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">said</span>, <br>
"I can take Dixie out for all his <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">bread</span>."

"But like you got to wait patiently, like a hustler on the sunny lands of New Mexico. <br>
Because I don't want you around when I take off this clown, and I get him hung up in my den. <br>
But when I pull through, baby I'll come straight to you, and you'll never have to hustle again."

So the next morning, I jumped in my $500 dollar grey silk <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">vine</span> <br>
I downed me a pint of ice cold <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">wine</span> <br>
I snatched my <u>black bank book</u>, and I made reservations on TWA <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">airline</span>. <br>
Now, my stay wasn't <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">bad</span>. <br>
I had a fabulous <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">pad</span>. <br>
I pulled plenty of fabulous <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">hoes</span>. <br>
I pulled Miss Carmen <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Vista</span>, who was huge in the <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Keister</span>, and first cousin to Mexicali <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">Rose</span>. <br>
Now, the climate was <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">hot</span>, and there was plenty of <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">pot</span>, and the tequila's were <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">dynamite</span>. <br>
As I laid my shot on top of Carmen's back, and she was on her knees all <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">night</span>.

Now one morning, <br>
As I patiently <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">waited</span>, I got a telegram that <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">stated</span>, <br>
It said, "Papa daddy, I made a real grand slam. <br>
I'm on my <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">way</span>. <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">TWA</span>. <br>
Comet' number 3. <br>
I'll be in New Mexico by <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">four</span>, I can't say no <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">more</span>. <br>
Love, your fine woman D"

Carmen then gave me a bath in ice cold <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">milk</span>, and I jumped in my $500 dollar grey <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">silk</span>, <br>
and downed me a <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">pint</span> of ice-cold <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">wine</span>, <br>
when I dug the New York news,  that shook me in my shoes with its bold daring <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">headline</span>... <br>
It said, "Bulletin: Last night, Dixie <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">Fair</span>... drug store <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">millionaire</span>, committed <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">suicide</span>... <br>
Left all his <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">fame</span> to Miss Du <span style="background-color:#a8e6cf;">Fontaine</span>, stated to be his <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">bride</span>."

So Jim, I made a beeline on down to the airport, just in time to hear the announcer say, <br>
"Attention in the lobby, Attention in Lobby: <br>
Relatives and friends of passengers on Comet' number 3, <br>
Wait no longer, for in fate's cruel hands, the good Comet has <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">crashed</span> off the coast known as Chili <span style="background-color:#dcedc1;">Sands</span>

But wait! The rescuers said that there was a woman alive! <br>
Age 25... <br>
Hair glossy black... <br>
Eyes a deep sea <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">green-blue</span>, <br>
Skin a boss dark <span style="background-color:#ffd3b6;">hue</span>. <br>
She said she was on her <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">way</span> to her fine man in <span style="background-color:#ffaaa5;">grey</span>, stated to be his bride. <br>
She would have been his true-blue <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">bitch</span>, and would've made him <span style="background-color:#e4dcf1;">rich</span>, <br>
but Jim she <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">coughed</span> up blood and <span style="background-color:#bdeaee;">died</span>."

Oh lord! That hurt me <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">blue</span>! <br>
But I pulled <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">through</span>, like all damned stud's <span style="background-color:#e3f0ff;">do</span>, <br>
But I know I'll never be the <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">same</span>. <br>
Cause there'll never be another Miss Doriella Du <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Fontaine</span>. <br>
That's her name, Miss Du <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Fontaine</span>. <br>
That's her name, Miss Du <span style="background-color:#fff6e9;">Fontaine</span>...

## Appendix B: Audacity Project

Hoping to discover intricate patterns in the breaks, I used the software Audacity to isolate all the breaks and verses of the track. While it did not aid me much, it is still useful to be able to hear the lyrics and the breaks independently: [file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dw5spkq4rigbgzm/DDF.aup). To open the project, please use the free open-source software [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).
