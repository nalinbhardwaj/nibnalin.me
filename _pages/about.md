Hi, I'm nibnalin! ~~I'm a math and literature student at UC San Diego, and a tech hobbyist.~~ I took an indefinite leave of absence from UCSD and now work at [Lunchclub](https://lunchclub.ai).

I use this space as an experimental ground to develop my own ideas and share them with others. I've found that I learn a lot more _in public_ (whether it is in IRL conversations or long winded email threads), and this website intends to encourage those interactions. As a result, most of the things I write about here are rather weakly held strong opinions, or summarizations, meant to be treated as interesting indulgences, not defining beliefs.

I don't know who I want to be when I grow up. Eternally looking for an answer.
